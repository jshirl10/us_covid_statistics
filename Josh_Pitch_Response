The Pitch Response
Josh Shirley

This is a project that I am interested in joining for a few reasons. I think there is a great need for such data in society right now. 
There are many opinions about what to do and not do with COVID-19, so this would help clarify what methods and practices are working. 
I am interested in being a part of the solution. Also, this project caught my attention because it is a project that is driven by data. 
I am a CS: Data Science major, so I am interested in collecting and analyzing data that makes conclusions.
	
Legally, public sources are the easiest to collect data from. From the business standpoint, I think that the more unbiased it is, the better. 
Data should always be unbiased. I am excited about the implementation with MySQL as that is something that I am learning in other classes that I have right now. 
A key-value NoSQL database seems logical and I am excited to learn about the implementation of that.
